# Tiny AMSTRAD CPC port ESP32

I've forked Ackerman's code to implement loading DSK files from SD card. Code is not the best, only a quick&dirty patch, but it just works. 

Thanks to Akerman for this port. CPC was my first computer and I'm really enjoying having it running inside such a small device.
